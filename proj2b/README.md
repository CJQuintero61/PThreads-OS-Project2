### proj2b.c

This directory contains the source code, the makefile, and the readme for 
project 2 part b. The goal is to create a m x n matrix where Y = AX
where A is integer inputs from 0-99, X is the x vector with the solutions for system
of equations, and Y is the result vector when multiplying AX. Then, use threads to solve the x vector.

To Run:
  1. must be in a unix based terminal or wsl
  2. `make` to compile
  3. `make run` to execute the program
  4. follow any user prompts if applicable
  5. `make clean` to remove the compiled files
